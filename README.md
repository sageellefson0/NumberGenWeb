# Digit Disorder 

Welcome to the repo for a fun little web game I worked on in my spare time. 
This game may eventually be converted to a Java application - but is currently available for play at: https://sageellefson.com/indexNumberGen.html

# Try to win on 10 slots for a awesome winning surprise! ;) 

How to Play:
• The object of the game is to place 5 or 10 numbers, between 1 - 1000 in the correct sequential order.

• To start the game, press the "Generate Start Number" button and get your first number.

• Click on the slots below to place the number where you think it belongs in sequential order.

• If a number is placed out of order or the restart button is pressed, a loss will be added to your loss tally.

• If all numbers are placed in the correct sequential order, a win will be added to your win tally.
